Title:          sctplib
Version:        1.0.21
Entered-date:   2018-10-03
Description:    The sctplib library is a prototype implementation of the Stream
                Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), a message-oriented
                reliable transport protocol that supports multi-homing, and
                multiple message streams multiplexed within an SCTP connection
                (also named association). SCTP is described in RFC 4960,
                RFC 3309 and RFC 3286. See http://www.sctp.de/ for details.
                The API of the library was modeled after section 10 of RFC 4960,
                and most parameters and functions should be self-explanatory to
                the user familiar with this document. In addition to these
                interface functions between an Upper Layer Protocol (ULP) and an
                SCTP instance, the library also provides a number of helper
                functions that can be used to manage callbacks and timers, as
                well as UDP sockets for simple IPC.
