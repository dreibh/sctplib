Description: User-space implementation of the SCTP protocol RFC 4960
 This package contains the shared library for SCTPLIB.
 .
 The SCTPLIB library is a fairly complete prototype implementation of the
 Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), a message-oriented reliable
 transport protocol that supports multi-homing, and multiple message streams
 multiplexed within an SCTP connection (also named association). SCTP is
 described in RFC 4960. This implementation is the product of a cooperation
 between Siemens AG (ICN), Munich, Germany and the Computer Networking
 Technology Group at the IEM of the University of Essen, Germany.
 .
 The API of the library was modeled after Section 10 of RFC 4960, and most
 parameters and functions should be self-explanatory to the user familiar with
 this document. In addition to these interface functions between an Upper
 Layer Protocol (ULP) and an SCTP instance, the library also provides a number
 of helper functions that can be used to manage callback function routines to
 make them execute at a certain point of time (i.e. timer-based) or open and
 bind  UDP sockets on a configurable port, which may then be used for an
 asynchronous interprocess communication.
