%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{General Concepts}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The sctplib-1.0 library release is the product of a cooperation between
Siemens AG (ICN), Munich, Germany and the Computer Networking Technology Group
at the IEM of the University of Essen, Germany.
It has been developed since late 1999 and has been planned to become a fairly
complete prototype implementation of the SCTP protocol as described in~\cite{RFC4960}.

\p
The API of the function library was modeled after section 10 of the
RFC 4960~\cite{RFC4960},
and most parameters an functions should be self-explanatory to the user familiar
with this document.
In addition to the interface functions between an Upper Layer Protocol (ULP)
and an SCTP instance,
the library also provides a number of helper functions that can be used
to manage callback function routines to make them execute at a certain point of 
time (i.e.\ timer-based)
or open and bind  UDP sockets on a configurable port, which may then be used
for an asynchronous interprocess communication.

\p
All of these functions may be made use of by simply linking the static
\libname{libsctp}-library to an application, and including the file \filename{sctp.h}.
As SCTP operates on top of IP, we chose to open a raw socket to catch all
incoming packets with the IP protocol id byte set to 132 (=SCTP). For this,
it is necessary that an application using the library functions
have privileges to do so. On most Unix machines that means this application
has to be run by root (i.e.\ be made setuid 0).

\p
An application making use of the \lib can expect to
be able to manage a large number of associations (e.g. as a server, all bound to
one port) as well as handle several so-called \emph{SCTP instances}, which may work
on several different ports. Ports of incoming packets are checked whether they
belong to an already existing association or may start a new one.

\p
The concept of the library is the following: After registration of a first
\emph{SCTP instance}, sockets are opened and an application may register timer
events, or file descriptors, that asynchronously trigger execution of  callback
functions. The function callbacks for these routines are passed in the
registration functions, and callbacks for SCTP  events are passed in
a \datatype{SCTP_ulpCallbacks} (described more closely in
sections~\ref{callbacks} and \ref{sctp2ulp}).

Then the application either calls the possibly blocking function 
\funcname{sctp_eventLoop} or the nonblocking function \funcname{sctp_getEvents}.
While calling the former, it will react to a previously scheduled timer or any
file descriptor event (by executing the registered callback functions).
In case a timer is scheduled at a very late point in time, and no events
happen on registered file descriptors (e.g. sockets), the program will
sleep (because the system call \funcname{poll} is used.
In this case, the control flow is handled by the library, and the user 
{\bf must} register appropriate callbacks for events and timers before handing 
control over to the  \funcname{sctp_eventLoop} function.
The proper use of the \funcname{sctp_eventLoop} is explained in some simple
example programs in section \ref{programs}.

On the other hand, there is also the function  \funcname{sctp_getEvents}
which may be used to check for timer or file descriptor events. If there
are none, it returns immediately. While scheduling CPU intensive functions
to run, an application should call this function in between in order
to treat SCTP events while performing other tasks.

\subsection{Notes}
Note that the \lib depends on a software packet (glib-2.0) for portable definition of
types, list functions etc.
Since we started using this late during the
project's development cycle, its application is sometimes not very 
consequent. We continue working on that, though, so things should clean
up a bit during later releases. For one, removal of the \filename{dll_main.c/.h}
files is planned in favor of the glib-list functions,
so that linked list handling will become less prone
to inefficient use of \funcname{malloc} and \funcname{free}.

\section{Convenient Use of the Library}
If you compile the entire project, and install the files
\filename{sctp.h} in the directory \texttt{/usr/local/include}
and \filename{libsctp.a} in \texttt{/usr/local/lib} (by simply
copying these from the \texttt{libsctp/sctp/} subdirectory
to their repective destinations, it is trivial to compile
an application.

Let's assume, your application is named \libname{app}
and consists of the file \filename{app.c}. If you use \texttt{gcc} as
compiler, it is sufficient to issue the command
\begin{verbatim}
host:~> gcc -o app app.c -lsctp -lglib2.0
\end{verbatim}
in order to compile your application.

\section{Features of the Implementation}
The implementation is able to establish associations according to RFC~4960 and
its interoperablility has been tested with implementations of about 25 companies.
It features a complete API according to section 10 of RFC~4960~\cite{RFC4960}.
Naturally it supports the SCTP multihoming features, and is able to handle
all-IPv4  as well as all-IPv6 or mixed IPv4/IPv6 associations.
An association may be established using a Cookie-structure that is secured
by a secret key and a secure MD5 hash function message authentication
code.

The data path implements the flow control features as prescribed in the RFC,
and supports the delayed acknowledgement feature, the delay of which may be configured,
optionally.
Using the \funcname{sctp_setPathStatus}, \funcname{sctp_setAssocStatus} and
\funcname{sctp_setAssocDefaults} functions, a wide range of protocol parameters
may optionally be configured for each association.

There can be several SCTP instances per host, provided they have a set of
disjoint local transport addresses.
The implementation also supports \emph{reassembly} of fragmented chunks, and
delivery of unordered chunks, as well as ordered chunks.

As of version \libname{sctplib-1.0.0-pre14} we also support fragmented data
transmission as well as reception of fragmented chunks.

\section{What is Missing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reception and creation of Error Chunks is not fully implemented, a number 
of hooks are provisioned that do not actually do anything, yet.
\item Handling of ICMP messages is not currently being done. So we do NOT do MTU
path discovery, as prescribed by~\cite{RFC4960}.
\item A few API functions are in the API, but currently do not do anything
(namely  \funcname{sctp_receiveUnsent}, \funcname{sctp_receiveUnacked} and
\funcname{sctp_setPathStatus}).
\item The \texttt{CommunicationError}-notification callback is never
called.
\item Probably there is some more. Additions, comments, bug-reports and
bug-fixes as welll as patches, patches, and patches are always welcome~!

\section{The API}
\subsection{Constants}
The maximum size of an IPv4/IPv6 address string is limited to \globalname{SCTP_MAX_IP_LEN}.
An endpoint may (for now) have a maximum number of addresses, which is limited to
\globalname{SCTP_MAX_NUM_ADDRESSES}. The maximum size of a datagram that may be passed
to the \funcname{sctp_send} function is \globalname{SCTP_MAXIMUM_DATA_LENGTH}. Since
we do NOT do proper MTU path discovery in this release, we cannot guarantee that
IP fragmentation occurs, but for Ethernet hardware type and most packets, these
settings will ensure that there is no fragmentation.
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#define SCTP_MAX_IP_LEN           46
#define SCTP_MAX_NUM_ADDRESSES    20
#define SCTP_MAXIMUM_DATA_LENGTH  1400
\end{verbatim}\n
\noindent
The following constants  have been defined for the state of an association:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#define SCTP_CLOSED               0
#define SCTP_COOKIE_WAIT          1
#define SCTP_COOKIE_ECHOED        2
#define SCTP_ESTABLISHED          3
#define SCTP_SHUTDOWN_PENDING     4
#define SCTP_SHUTDOWN_RECEIVED    5
#define SCTP_SHUTDOWN_SENT        6
#define SCTP_SHUTDOWNACK_SENT     7
\end{verbatim}\n
\noindent
When the status of a \emph{path} changes, the following values may be assumed:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#define SCTP_PATH_OK              0
#define SCTP_PATH_UNREACHABLE     1
\end{verbatim}\n
\noindent
For setting the heartbeat (see section~\ref{sctp-changeHeartBeat}, \funcname{sctp_changeHeartBeat}),
these constants may be used:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#define SCTP_HEARTBEAT_ON         1
#define SCTP_HEARTBEAT_OFF        0
\end{verbatim}\n
\noindent
When calling \funcname{sctp_send} (see section~\ref{sctp-send}), the following
constants may be used to select, how chunks are sent. For delivery with
or without stream reordering, one may set:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#define SCTP_UNORDERED_DELIVERY   1
#define SCTP_ORDERED_DELIVERY     0
\end{verbatim}\n
\noindent
When calling \funcname{sctp_receive} (see section below), the following flags 
can be passed along:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#define SCTP_MSG_DEFAULT          0x00
#define SCTP_MSG_PEEK             0x02
\end{verbatim}\n
\noindent
The former can be used to achieve the default behavior, i.e. data is taken
from the streamengine, and copied into a user-supplied buffer. After that 
the data is deleted within the stream-engine.
The use of the \globalname{SCTP_MSG_PEEK} flag allows for copying the data
into a user-supplied buffer without deleting it from the stream-engine.
A second call to \funcname{sctp_receive} will then yield the same data.

To prevent messages from being bundled, the following constants may be passed
as parameters to   \funcname{sctp_send}:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#define SCTP_BUNDLING_ENABLED     0
#define SCTP_BUNDLING_DISABLED    1
\end{verbatim}\n
\noindent
Three more constants may be needed frequently for \funcname{sctp_send},
\begin{enumerate}
\item for path selection, if the primary path is to be taken
(which is the default):
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#define SCTP_USE_PRIMARY          -1
\end{verbatim}\n
\item this is used to have chunks have an unlimited lifetime:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#define SCTP_INFINITE_LIFETIME    0
\end{verbatim}\n
\item if there is no context passed along (which otherwise might be used for
data retrieval - but that has not yet been implemented):
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#define SCTP_NO_CONTEXT           NULL
\end{verbatim}\n
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
In order to encourage future proper and consequent use of appropriate error
return codes for functions (which unfortunately up to now has only partially been
implemented), a number of return codes have been defined. They are:
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#define SCTP_SUCCESS                    0
#define SCTP_UNSPECIFIED_ERROR          -1
#define SCTP_SPECIFIC_FUNCTION_ERROR    1
\end{verbatim}\n

\subsection{Type Definitions}
The main include file of \filename{sctp.h} defines a number of types that
are used throughout the library as well as in some of the interface functions.
They will be explained in the subsequent sections.

\subsubsection{\datatype{SCTP_ulpCallbacks}}
\label{callbacks}
This is a structure containing pointers to functions (used as callbacks for
SCTP events that may occur and that the ULP needs to be notified of), which are
all explained in detail in section \ref{sctp2ulp}.
This structure is usually initialized early in the program, and then passed
to the function \funcname{sctp_registerInstance} (see section~\ref{register}),
which in turn 
registers the appropriate functions from this structure for the corresponding 
events.
\bv
struct SCTP_ulp_Callbacks
{
   void  (*dataArriveNotif)  (unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int,
                              unsigned int, unsigned int,   void*);
   void  (*sendFailureNotif) (unsigned int, unsigned char *, unsigned int,
                              unsigned int *, void*);
   void  (*networkStatusChangeNotif) (unsigned int, short, unsigned short, void*);
   void* (*communicationUpNotif) (unsigned int, unsigned short,
                                  int, unsigned short, unsigned short, void*);
   void  (*communicationLostNotif)  (unsigned int, unsigned short, void*);
   void  (*communicationErrorNotif) (unsigned int, unsigned short, void*);
   void  (*restartNotif) (unsigned int, void*);
   void  (*shutdownCompleteNotif) (unsigned int, void*);
}SCTP_ulpCallbacks;
\end{verbatim}\n


\subsubsection{\datatype{SCTP_InstanceParameters}}
\label{instance-params}
This struct contains variables that may be set per SCTP instance (as defaults),
and can subsequently set or retrieved after an instance has been registered.
All associations that will be created from this instance will then inherit
these parameters.
\bv
struct SCTP_Instance_Parameters {
   /* the initial round trip timeout */
   unsigned int rtoInitial;
   /** the minimum timeout value */
   unsigned int rtoMin;
   /** the lifetime of a cookie */
   unsigned int validCookieLife;
   /** maximum retransmissions per association */
   unsigned int assocMaxRetransmits;
   /** maximum retransmissions per path */
   unsigned int pathMaxRetransmits;
   /** maximum initial retransmissions */
   unsigned int maxInitRetransmits;
   /** local receiver window */
   unsigned int myRwnd;
   /** delay for delayed ACK in msecs */
   unsigned int delay;
   /** per instance: for the IP type of service field. */
   unsigned char ipTos;
   /** currently unused, to limit the number of chunks
       queued in the send queue */
   unsigned int maxSendQueue;
   /** currently unused, may limit the number of chunks
       queued in the receive queue later. */
   unsigned int maxRecvQueue;
} SCTP_InstanceParameters;
\end{verbatim}
\n


\subsubsection{\datatype{SCTP_AssociationStatus}}
\label{association-status}
This struct contains variables that may be retrieved for each
 SCTP association.
A number of these parameters may even be set, and are marked accordingly in
the declaration.

These parameters can
subsequently be set or retrieved after a \texttt{CommunicationUp}
has been received.
The values contained in this structure give most of the important
data about the current association:
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
\item[rtoInitial]  initial round trip timeout.
\item[validCookieLife]  cookie life time.
\item[assocMaxRetransmits]
 maximum number of retransmission before the peer is considered unreachable.
\item[pathMaxRetransmits]
maximum number of retransmission before a destination address is considered unreachable.
\item[maxInitRetransmits]
maximum number of retransmissions of init and cookie messages.
\item[state]
returns an unsigned integer representing the state of
the association. The states have been defined as:
\begin{itemize}
\item \globalname{SCTP_CLOSED}
\item \globalname{SCTP_COOKIE_WAIT}
\item \globalname{SCTP_COOKIE_ECHOED}
\item \globalname{SCTP_ESTABLISHED}
\item \globalname{SCTP_SHUTDOWN_PENDING}
\item \globalname{SCTP_SHUTDOWN_RECEIVED}
\item \globalname{SCTP_SHUTDOWN_SENT}
\item \globalname{SCTP_SHUTDOWNACK_SENT}
\end{itemize}
\item[numberOfAddresses]
returns the number of destination addresses this
association has, i.e.\ the number of possible paths.
\item[primaryDestinationAddress]
returns a string containing the primary IP destination address
\item[inStreams] number of inbound streams
\item[outStreams] number of outbound streams
\end{description} \end{quote}
\bv
struct SCTP_Association_Status
{
  /** (get)  */
  unsigned short state;
  /**  (get) */
  unsigned short numberOfAddresses;
  /**  (get) */
  unsigned char  primaryDestinationAddress[SCTP_MAX_IP_LEN];
  /**  (get) */
  unsigned short outStreams;
  /**  (get) */
  unsigned short inStreams;
  /**  (get/set) */
  unsigned short primaryAddressIndex;
  /**  (get) */
  unsigned int   currentReceiverWindowSize;
  /**  (get) */
  unsigned int   outstandingBytes;
  /**  (get) */
  unsigned int   noOfChunksInSendQueue;
  /**  (get) */
  unsigned int   noOfChunksInRetransmissionQueue;
  /**  (get) */
  unsigned int   noOfChunksInReceptionQueue;
  /** (get/set) the initial round trip timeout */
  unsigned int   rtoInitial;
  /** (get/set) the minimum RTO timeout */
  unsigned int   rtoMin;
  /** (get/set) the maximum RTO timeout */
  unsigned int   rtoMax;
  /** (get/set) the lifetime of a cookie */
  unsigned int   validCookieLife;
  /** (get/set) maximum retransmissions per association */
  unsigned int   assocMaxRetransmits;
  /** (get/set) maximum retransmissions per path */
  unsigned int   pathMaxRetransmits;
  /** (get/set) maximum initial retransmissions */
  unsigned int   maxInitRetransmits;
  /** (get/set) local receiver window */
  unsigned int myRwnd;
  /** (get/set) delay for delayed ACK in msecs */
  unsigned int delay;
  /** (get/set) per instance: for the IP type of service field. */
  unsigned char ipTos;
  /** currently unused, to limit the number of chunks
       queued in the send queue */
  unsigned int maxSendQueue;
   /** currently unused, may limit the number of chunks
       queued in the receive queue later. */
  unsigned int maxRecvQueue;
} SCTP_AssociationStatus;
\end{verbatim}
\n


\subsubsection{\datatype{SCTP_PathStatus}}
\label{pathstatus-struct}
This struct contains path specific parameters. These
values can only be retrieved using the function \funcname{sctp_getPathStatus},
 when the association already exists. Setting of these parameters is
currently NOT implemented, although the API already contains the
function  \funcname{sctp_setPathStatus}, that may be used for
this purpose in a later release.

This struct also contains values from the flow control module, and
may thus be used to check the status of the congestion control
mechanisms.
\bv
struct SCTP_Path_Status
{
  unsigned char destinationAddress[SCTP_MAX_IP_LEN];
  /**  SCTP_PATH_ACTIVE  0, SCTP_PATH_INACTIVE   1    */
  short state;
  /** smoothed round trip time in msecs */
  unsigned int srtt;
  /** current rto value in msecs */
  unsigned int rto;
  /** round trip time variation, in msecs */
  unsigned int rttvar;
  /** defines the rate at which heartbeats are sent */
  unsigned int heartbeatIntervall;
  /**  congestion window size */
  unsigned int cwnd;
  /**  congestion window size 2  */
  unsigned int cwnd2;
  /**  Partial Bytes Acked  */
  unsigned int partialBytesAcked;
  /**  Slow Start Threshold  */
  unsigned int ssthresh;
  unsigned int outstandingBytesPerAddress;
  /**  Current MTU (flowcontrol) */
  unsigned int mtu;
  /** per path ? per instance ? for the IP type of service field. */
  unsigned char ipTos;
}SCTP_PathStatus;
\end{verbatim} \n


\subsubsection{\datatype{sctp_socketCallback}}
\bv
typedef void (*sctp_socketCallback) (int, unsigned char *, int,
                                     unsigned char[] , unsigned short);

\end{verbatim}
\n
A callback function type used for registering callbacks for 
socket events (for events POLLIN or POLLPRI).
The parameters that are passed by the sctp library, when a socket has been
active are (in this order): 
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
\item[\datatype{int}] socket file descriptor of the socket where a datagram was received
\item[\datatype{unsigned char*}] pointer to the data
\item[\datatype{int}] length of datagram
\item[\datatype{unsigned char[]}] source address string (from which originated the data)
\item[\datatype{unsigned short}] source port (for UDP data, not SCTP data !)
\end{description} \end{quote}

\subsubsection{\datatype{sctp_timerCallback}}
\bv
typedef void (*sctp_timerCallback) (unsigned int, void *, void *);
\end{verbatim}
\n
Defines the callback function that is called when a timer expires.
Parameters: 
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
\item[\datatype{unsigned int}] ID of timer
\item[\datatype{void*}] pointer to param1
\item[\datatype{void*}] pointer to param2
\end{description} \end{quote}
param1 and param2 are pointers to data that are returned to the callback
function, when the timer expires. These must still exist at
that time and point to valid data !
    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Helper Functions}
The \lib contains a few functions that influence the general
control flow of a program using them, and are needed to create
an application that works as expected.
The important functions needed in {\em any} program using the \lib are
the functions \funcname{sctp_eventLoop} and \funcname{sctp_getEvents}

\subsubsection{\funchead{sctp_eventLoop}}
Basically this is a wrapper to a \funcname{poll} or \funcname{select}-system
call. The function waits until either of one events occurrs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the time for which a timer event was scheduled has passed by, so 
the callback function belonging to that (previously registered) event is
executed.
\item one of the sockets that had previously been registered with 
the function \funcname{sctp_registerUdpCallback} or the raw socket
that waits for incoming SCTP packets has encountered a read event, 
so there is data available. The appropriate function callback is then
called to treat that event.
\end{enumerate}
The control flow of the program is given to the callback function
which may in turn register new timer events. The function returns
-1 if an error ocurrs, 0 if a timeout has ocurred, or else
the number of file descriptor events that have been treated.
\bv
int sctp_eventLoop();
\end{verbatim}
\n

\subsubsection{\funchead{sctp_getEvents}}
Basically this is a wrapper to a \funcname{poll} or \funcname{select}-system
call (if such a syscall exists on the used OS). The function checks whether a timer
event needs to be handled and does so, if the time has arisen.
Then it checks via the  \funcname{poll}-system call whether events
on the socket need to be handled, and does so, if there are any.

After these events have been handled, it returns the number of events
handled, 0 if none had to be
handled (i.e.\ a timer had been handled) or -1 if an error has
occurred.
\bv
int sctp_getEvents();
\end{verbatim}
\n

\subsubsection{\funchead{sctp_registerUdpCallback}}
This function is supposed to open and bind a UDP socket listening on a port
to incoming UDP pakets from a local IP address. 
After that it registers a callback function that is called, to dispacth
UDP data which  arrives for that local address.
The function takes the following parameters:
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
\item[\funcparam{me}] local address string (zero-terminated)
\item[\funcparam{my_port}] the UDP port to bind (locally)
\item[\funcparam{scf}]  callback funtion that is called when data has arrived
\end{description} \end{quote}
It returns a new UDP socket file descriptor, or -1 if error ocurred.
\bv
int sctp_registerUdpCallback(unsigned char me[],
                             unsigned short my_port,
                             sctp_socketCallback scf);
\end{verbatim}
\n

\subsubsection{\funchead{sctp_registerStdinCallback}}
This function is supposed to register a callback function for catching
input from the Unix STDIN file descriptor. We expect this to be useful
in test programs mainly, so it is provided here for convenience.
Events on this file descriptor are dispatched differently, as applications
may read directly from STDIN (i.e. the callback  function buffer does not
contain the data from STDIN, and the registered callback function may retrieve
this data with functions as \funcname{fgets}).

\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
\item[\funcparam{scf}]  callback funtion that is called when data has arrived
\end{description} \end{quote}
It returns 0, or -1 if an error ocurred.
\bv
int sctp_registerStdinCallback(sctp_socketCallback scf);
\end{verbatim} \n

\subsubsection{\funchead{sctp_startTimer}}
This function adds a callback that is to be called some time from now. 
It realizes the timer (in an ordered list).
The function takes the following parameters:
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
\item[\funcparam{milliseconds}] action is to be started in milliseconds ms from now
\item[\funcparam{timer_cb}] pointer to a function to be executed, when timer expires
\item[\funcparam{param1}]  pointer to be returned to the caller when timer expires
\item[\funcparam{param2}]  pointer to be returned to the caller when timer expires
\end{description} \end{quote}
The function returns a timer ID value, that can be used to cancel or
restart this timer.
{\bf NOTE:} the pointers \funcparam{param1} and \funcparam{param2}
exist to point to data useful for the function callback. They need to 
point to data that is still valid at the time the callback is activated.
Do not pass pointers to temporary objects !
\bv
unsigned int sctp_startTimer(unsigned int milliseconds,
                        sctp_timerCallback timer_cb, void *param1, void *param2);

This function stops a previously started timer.
The function takes the following parameter:
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
\item[\funcparam{tid}]  timer-id of timer to be removed
\end{description} \end{quote}
The function returns 0 on success, 1 if tid not in the list, -1 on error.
\bv
int sctp_stopTimer(unsigned int tid);
\end{verbatim} \n

\subsubsection{\funchead{sctp_restartTimer}}
Restarts a timer that is currently running.
The function takes the following parameters:
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
\item[\funcparam{timer_id}] the timer id returned by start_timer 
\item[\funcparam{milliseconds}] action is to be taken in milliseconds ms from now
\end{description} \end{quote}
The function returns a new timer ID, zero when there is an error (i.e. the
timer was not running). The function basically stops the old timer, and sets a new
timer. So it is there for convenience. The timer ID will be different
after calling this function !
\bv
unsigned int sctp_restartTimer(unsigned int timer_id, unsigned int milliseconds);
\end{verbatim} \n


\subsubsection{\funchead{sctp_getTime}}
This helper function returns a 32 bit value representing the current time in
milliseconds. Beware, this counter wraps about once per 20 days. Keep that in
mind when calculating time differences ! This function may be useful,
or may not be useful.

\subsubsection{\funchead{sctp_initLibrary}}
\label{initLibrary}
This function will open raw sockets for capturing SCTP packets
(IPv4 and if possible, IPv6, too) from the network and
initialize the timer list.
{\em It needs to be called before any other functions of the
\lib are called !}

\bv
int sctp_initLibrary(void);

\subsubsection{\funchead{sctp_registerInstance}}
\label{register}
\funcname{sctp_registerInstance} is called to initialize one SCTP instance.
An application may register several instances with different sets of
callback functions, but there should not be several instances with
the same port.
If the port is set to zero, the instance will not be able to receive any
datagrams, unless the \funcname{sctp_associate} function is called. So
it does not make sense to specify 0 as port number, unless the application
is a client. A server needs a port number greater than 0 here.
A client may have the \lib choose a free source port by specifying
zero.\\
The function takes the following parameters:
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
\item[\funcparam{localPort}] port of this SCTP instance
\item[\funcparam{noOfInStreams}] default maximum inbound stream number
\item[\funcparam{noOfOutStreams}] default maximum outbound stream number

\subsubsection{\funchead{sctp_unregisterInstance}}
\label{unregister}
\funcname{sctp_unregisterInstance} is called to release resources used by

If no instances are registered for either
IPv4 or IPv6 raw sockets any more, callbacks for these sockets are
also removed.\\
To be checked here:
\begin{itemize}
\item Check that all resources belonging to an instance are correctly
released. What about chunks that are still in the queues ?
\end{itemize}
The function takes the following parameters:
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
\item[\funcparam{instance_name}] name of the SCTP instance to un-register
\end{description} \end{quote}

The function takes the following parameters:
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
\item[\funcparam{SCTP_InstanceName}]  
the SCTP instance this association belongs to. If the local port of this SCTP instance 
is zero, we will get a free port number assigned, else we will use the one
specified in the call to \funcname{sctp_registerInstance}.
\item[\funcparam{noOfOutStreams}] number of output streams the ULP would like to have.
\item[\funcparam{destinationAddress}] destination address string (zero-terminated) containing the
 address which the INIT will be sent to.
\item[\funcparam{destinationPort}]  destination port
\item[\funcparam{ulp_data}]  void pointer, that will be returned with each callback.
May be used by the ULP to find data faster.

\subsection{SCTP-to-ULP}
\label{sctp2ulp}
All notifcations are realized via callbacks, i.e.\ upon registering a new SCTP
instance, the ULP has to pass a struct containing pointers to a set of functions, 
that will be called when the respective event occurs, with appropriate
parameters. 

The \texttt{CommunicationUp}-notification may return a pointer
to a data structure that the upper layer is interested in. This pointer
is subsequently registered within the new association structure, and passed
along transparently with all callbacks.

\subsubsection{DataArrive Notification}
Indicates that new data has arrived from peer (chapter 10.2.A).
The parameters passed with this callback are (in this order):

                          unsigned int, unsigned int *, void*);
\end{verbatim}\n

\subsubsection{NetworkStatusChange Indication}
Indicates a change of network status, i.e. a path has changed from state
SCTP_PATH_OK to SCTP_PATH_UNREACHABLE, or vice versa. (chapter 10.2.C).
If there is only \emph{one} active path left, which turns INACTIVE, a
\texttt{CommunicationLost}-notification is given instead of a
\texttt{NetworkStatusChange}.\\
The parameters passed with this callback are (in this order):
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
 \item[\datatype{unsigned int}] association ID
 \item[\datatype{short}] index of  the destination address concerned

 \item[\datatype{unsigned short}] number input streamns
 \item[\datatype{unsigned short}] number output streams
 \item[\datatype{void*}] pointer to upper layer data
\end{description} \end{quote}
The function (i.e.\ the upper layer~!) may return a pointer that
the upper layer is intersted in.
This pointer will then be passed along with all subsequent notification
calls.
\bv
void* (*communicationUpNotif) (unsigned int, unsigned short, int,
                               unsigned short, unsigned short, void*);
\end{verbatim}\n

\subsubsection{CommunicationLost Notification}
Indicates that the association with the peer was closed for
some reason (chapter 10.2.E). 
The parameters passed with this callback are (in this order):
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
 \item[\datatype{unsigned int}] association ID
 \item[\datatype{unsigned short}] status, type of event;
	the following events are defined: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \globalname{SCTP_COMM_LOST_ABORTED} \\
ULP has called \funcname{sctp_abort}, and an ABORT chunk has been sent
out, or we have received an ABORT chunk from the peer. The association
has been terminated.
	\item \globalname{SCTP_COMM_LOST_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE} \\
All paths have turned unreachable.
	\item \globalname{SCTP_COMM_LOST_EXCEEDED_RETRANSMISSIONS}\\
The number of retransmissions has been exceeded in normal
transmission of data or heartbeat chunks, or the number of
retransmissions of INIT, COOKIE_ECHO, SHUTDOWN or SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE
chunks have been exceeded.
	\item \globalname{SCTP_COMM_LOST_NO_TCB}\\
SCTP instance has received SHUTDOWN chunk from a peer in state
\globalname{SCTP_CLOSED}, or a SHUTDOWN_ACK in any of the states
\globalname{SCTP_CLOSED}, \globalname{SCTP_COOKIE_WAIT} or
\globalname{SCTP_COOKIE_ECHOED}.
	\item \globalname{SCTP_COMM_LOST_ZERO_STREAMS}\\
SCTP instance has received an otherwise valid INIT chunk requesting either
0 inbound or 0 outbound streams. We send an ABORT, and terminate the
association, if it exists.
	\item \globalname{SCTP_COMM_LOST_FAILURE}\\
Currently unsused.
	\end{itemize}
 \item[\datatype{void*}] pointer to upper layer data
\end{description} \end{quote}
\bv
void (*communicationLostNotif) (unsigned int, unsigned short, void*);
\end{verbatim}\n

\subsubsection{CommunicationError Notification}
Indicates that communication had an error (chapter 10.2.F).
Currently not implemented !
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
 \item[\datatype{unsigned int}] association ID
 \item[\datatype{unsigned short}] status, type of error
 \item[\datatype{void*}] pointer to upper layer data
\end{description} \end{quote}
\bv
void (*communicationErrorNotif) (unsigned int, unsigned short, void*);
\end{verbatim}\n

\subsubsection{Restart Indication}
Indicates that a restart has occurred (chapter 10.2.G).
The notification has been added to our implementation lately,
but the restart scenario is still somewhat untested. So we need
feedback here~!
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
 \item[\datatype{unsigned int}] association ID
 \item[\datatype{void*}] pointer to upper layer data
\end{description} \end{quote}
\bv
void (*restartNotif) (unsigned int, void*);
\end{verbatim}\n

\subsubsection{ShutdownComplete Indication}
Indicates that a Shutdown has been successfully completed (chapter 10.2.H).
\begin{quote} \begin{description} \no
 \item[\datatype{unsigned int}] association ID
 \item[\datatype{void*}] pointer to upper layer data
\end{description} \end{quote}
\bv
void (*shutdownCompleteNotif) (unsigned int, void*);

\section{Example Programs}
\label{programs}
\subsection{A Discard Server}
\label{discard}
The discard-server is a very simple example for an
application and the appropriate use of the \lib.
The \funcname{main} function calls \funcname{getArgs}, which
parses some command line options,
that allow for changing default behavior of the discard server
to verbose or very verbose (respective \texttt{-v} or \texttt{-V}
options) and for specifying a number of source addresses.

Then, \funcname{main} assigns all callback functions to a
\datatype{SCTP_ulpCallbacks} variable, and calls upon
\funcname{sctp_registerInstance}, passing a number of default parameters
(e.g.\ port number 9). Finally, the function \funcname{sctp_eventLoop} is
executed in a loop that only terminates if a severe error is encountered.

The specified callback functions do nothing except logging the callback
events in verbose mode, and put received data into a local buffer that is
overwritten each time data arrives. So any data that arrives is discarded.

\subsection{An Echo Server}
\label{echo1}
The echo server is structured similarly to the discard server (see section~\ref{discard}).
The main difference of their functionalities is, of course, in
the callback functions. The general control flow is as follows:

the \funcname{main} function calls \funcname{getArgs}, which
parses some command line options,
that allow for changing default behavior of the echo server
to verbose or very verbose (respective \texttt{-v} or \texttt{-V}
options) and for specifying a number of source addresses.

Then, \funcname{main} assigns all callback functions to a
\datatype{SCTP_ulpCallbacks} variable, and calls upon
\funcname{sctp_registerInstance}, passing a number of default parameters
(e.g.\ port number 7). Finally, the function \funcname{sctp_eventLoop} is
executed in a loop that only terminates if a severe error is encountered.
The maximum number of associations the echo server can handle is
limited by the constant \globalname{MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_ASSOCIATIONS}.

\pp
The \texttt{CommunicationUp} callback function limits this number of
existing associations in that it calls \funcname{sctp_abort} when the
maximum number of existing associations is exceeded.

The interesting callback function is actually that for the \texttt{DataArrive}
notification. It receives the arrived data into a local buffer using the function
\funcname{sctp_receive}, and calls \funcname{sctp_send} to echo the data
back to the peer.

The callback for the \texttt{NetworkStatusChange} makes sure that as long as there
is an active path left in the association, the primary path is an active
path.

\subsection{An Echo Tool}
\label{echo2}
The echo tool works very  similar to the echo server, but has several modes
of operation. In the first, executed after using the \texttt{-b} switch, it
echoes incoming data back to all existing associations. 
Thus, it may be thought of as a multicast server.

In the second, executed after using the \texttt{-d} switch, it sends 
a configurable number of packets to a target endpoint. If this target
endpoint runs an echo server, the two endpoints will start echoing the
initial packets to each other. This supposedly generates high network load.

Finally, both modes may be combined.
The echo client takes the following command line options:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-s source address}] an IP source address belonging to this host
\item[\texttt{-d destination}] IP address of a destination (which may be
    running an echo server)
\item[\texttt{-b}] send back incoming data on all existing associations
\item[\texttt{-l length}] length of payload in bytes (must be less than
    SCTP_MAXIMUM_DATA_LENGTH==1400 bytes)
\item[\texttt{-n packets}] number of initial packets
\item[\texttt{-t IP_TOS_BYTE}] sets the IP_TOS_BYTE in the IP header. These values
    should be 2, 4, 8 or 16
\item[\texttt{-m}] print number of received bytes an chunks per period of time
\item[\texttt{-p period}] set period for the measurements in milliseconds
\item[\texttt{-v}] verbose execution
\item[\texttt{-V}] very verbose execution
